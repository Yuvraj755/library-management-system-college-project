        WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM?</b></h1>
        <div class="yuvraj"></div>
        <p>The purpose of a library management system is to operate a library with efficiency and at reduced costs. The system being entirely automated streamlines all the tasks involved in operations of the library. The activities of book purchasing, cataloging, indexing, circulation recording and stock checking are done by the software. Such software eliminates the need for repetitive manual work and minimizes the chances of errors.

            The library management system software helps in reducing operational costs. Managing a library manually is labor intensive and an immense amount of paperwork is involved. An automated system reduces the need for manpower and stationery. This leads to lower operational costs.
            
           digital age a web based library management system would be ideal for students who can access the library’s database on their smartphones.</p>

            <h1><b><u>HOW DO YOU DESIGN A LIBRARY
                MANAGEMENT SYSTEM?</u></b></h1>

                <p>
                    Library management systems are designed to manage the movement of books and maintain records of the members in a library. The software solution is designed based on the system requirements, the people involved, the content of the operation and the activity to be performed.
                    
                    The system requirement in library management focuses on the possibility of search for books by title, author or subject by the member. They should be able to locate a book physically by the unique identification code and the rack number for each book.
                    The system should provide details on the books held by the members. The system should limit the number of books that can be taken and the number of days that a book can be kept for. The system should generate fines when due from the member.
                    The next step focuses on the functions of the librarian, the member and the system. Managing books by the librarian, searching for books by the members and notifications sent by the system are detailed in a case diagram.
                     The software systems are developed on this platform.</p>
                    <h1><b><u>WHAT SYSTEM DOES A LIBRARY USE?</u></b></h1>
                    <p>The library management system software should be user-friendly and cost effective. It should be in tune with the establishment’s needs and compatible with the existing technology.

                        A library should use a software system that helps in effectively managing the data in a library. The library database includes all relevant information regarding assets to membership details. The software records details on all reading and reference material available for reading and lending. Membership information, lending details and renewal dates are managed by the software.
                        
                        A library management system software with capabilities of barcoding and RFID helps in scanning the barcode while lending or returning books. Management of the catalogue and inventory by the system makes the process accountable.
                        
                        The feature of the software assists in inventory and circulation management of the books. Books in stock, on the shelves, in circulation, missing or to be ordered can be tracked by the system. Acquiring new assets becomes easier with the software.</p>
                        <div class="manish"></div>
                        <p>Reports on members details, fees collected, pending payments and overdue fines are generated by the library management software system. Members are sent reminders on renewals and return dates. The software prints membership cards and creates user IDs.

                            Commonly used library management system websites world-wide are Handy Library Manager, Librarian, Insignia Library System, Lucidea Integrated Library Systems. The best library management system in India is MarvelSoft. GLibrary, My Library, Ampletrails Library are a few other web based library management systems used in India.</p>

                            <h1><b><u>HOW DO YOU MANAGE A LIBRARY?</u></b></h1>
                            <p>Managing a library requires knowledge of library management and skills to perform the activities. The task involves planning, decision making, organizing, collecting and disbursing information and controlling and monitoring the various functions.

                                The management should have an objective for running the library. They should have a clear idea of the members they wish to serve. The selection of books in different categories is dependent on the interests of the members.An understanding of the organizational hierarchy will enable proper delegation of responsibilities to the personnel employed. Governmental regulations regarding structure, space and systems should be in place.
                                
                                A budget has to be allocated for the operation of the library. Maintenance of the library has to be scheduled on a regular basis. Dusting, cleaning, pest control, exposure to air and sunlight, replacement of fixtures are essential in preserving the library.
                                
                                A proper inventory check has to be done annually to record the details of books in circulation. Provisions for the replacements have to be done accordingly.
                                
                                These are the basics for operating a library efficiently. In a traditional library all these functions were done manually by people. The process was time consuming and expensive. In today’s digital world software solutions have been developed for library management. This system performs all the adequate functions with increased efficiency and accuracy saving time and costs.
                                
                                Library management software system makes the primary functions of adding and deleting, issuing and returning of books very simple. The processes of book indexing, cataloging, book reservations and overdue notifications are automated. The software system makes the process simpler and more accountable.</p>

                                            Institutions have fixed budgets for technological improvements and consider installing new software as expensive. The one-time cost of installing the software may be high but in the long run it proves very cost effective as the maintenance cost is minimal. The system eliminates the need for a large workforce reducing the cost of operations.
                                            
                                            Productivity:
                                            
                                            Effective library management system software streamlines all the operations of the library. Database management, real-time reporting and communication with the members are done through the system. This saves the librarian a lot of time which he can utilize productively for other important work.</p>

                                                The library automation system should keep pace with global technological advancements, web design changes, virtual services and online information. The conventional libraries have shifted from manual operations to automated integrated library management systems to manage the entire gamut of operations.
                                                
                                                The new trend is digitizing the content of the library and providing open source platforms for access to all members. These platforms are integrated with each other to enable a broader spectrum for search and use from remote locations on a 24/7 basis.
                                                
                                                The members are provided access to digital content in addition to collection of books in print. The challenges faced by libraries are the dual management of physical collections and electronic content and the appropriate service for each medium.</b></p>
